Activity: Hello!

The purpose of this activity is for you to

<ul>

 <li>get started back in writing C or C++ code</li>

 <li>get familiar with running code on mamba</li>

</ul>

<strong>1        Hello on mamba </strong>

<strong>Question: </strong>Write a code that simply prints the name of the current machine. You can obtain that name using function gethostname (check man page for details). Write that code in file hello.cpp. You can test this works by compiling it with make hello.

<strong>Question: </strong>Run that code on a mamba compute node using ./queue hello.sh from the cluster head node. This will start a PBS job. Once this job has completed, a file hello answer will be created containing the name of the compute node the command has run on. Make sure you turn that hello answer file in.
